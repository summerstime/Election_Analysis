# Election Analysis for the Colorado Board of Elections

## Overview
   This project is to satisfy the requirements for the third challenge in the Data Analysis Bootcamp. For this, the task is to analyze/audit the results of a Colorado election. Tom and Seth are helping by reviewing the python code being written to programmatically review the data quickly and provide results as to the number of votes cast, the quantity per county, total votes per candidate, percentage of county votes, and the overall winner; among other tallied items to be shown here.
