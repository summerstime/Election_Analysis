# Election Analysis for the Colorado Board of Elections

## Overview
   This project is to satisfy the requirements for the third challenge in the Data Analysis Bootcamp. For this, the task is to analyze/audit the results of a Colorado election. Tom and Seth are helping by reviewing the python code being writen to programmatically review the data quickly and provide results as to the number of votes cast, the quantity per county, total votes per candidate, percentage of county votes, and the overall winner; among other tallied items to be shown here.

## Election Audit Results
  Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

### How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
### Which county had the largest number of votes?
### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
### Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Summary
Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
